# ER Diagram for AirBnB Clone Project

![ER Diagram](AirBnB%20Clone%20DB.png)

This Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram visualizes the foundational database structure for an AirBnB-like platform. It models the relationships between key entities:

* **Users** (guests, hosts, admins)
* **Properties** listed by hosts
* **Bookings** made by users
* **Payments** linked to bookings
* **Reviews** left by guests
* **Messages** exchanged between users

Together, these tables define the schema needed to support essential features like user registration, property listings, reservation handling, secure transactions, user feedback, and communication.
